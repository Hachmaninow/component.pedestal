# Introduction

I liked the idea of using Stuart Sierra's great Component library for Pedestal applications.
Fortunately I found this: https://github.com/stuartsierra/component.pedestal

With this I was nearly there, but exactly as advertised it did not work "as is"...

But as I could fix the remaining issues quite easily and the original author did not seem
to have the time to take ownership I forked the original repository...

Mainly I provided some scaffolding to be able to release the functionality as a library.

Apart from this I fixed one or two minor issues I had when integrating that with the
Pedestal version I am using.

Ah... and I changed the namespace because it felt a little weird not to match the library
artifact in any way ;-).
